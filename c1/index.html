        <h1>Chapter 1 - Hello World</h1>
        <h3>In this chapter, we'll set up our development environment and essential tools.</h3>
        <p>
            The first step in starting our project is to install Node.js. <a href="https://nodejs.org/">You can download Node.js from
            the official website by clicking here,</a> and then install it on your system by following the instructions provided. Node.js
            also comes bundled with a package manager called <code>npm</code>, which we'll use to install our dependencies and set up the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once Node.js has been installed, create a directory for your project, navigate to it using the command line and run the following command:
            <code class="codeblock">npm init</code>
            Follow the prompts and give your project a name of your choice along with some other basic details.
            If the initialization was successful, you should see a file called <code>package.json</code> in the project's directory.
            This file contains the essentail information about your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, <code>index.html</code> and <code>bundle.js</code>
            We will also need t
            <pre class="codeblock">
foo
bar
baz</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
			In a web browser context, all JavaScript code that needs to be executed by the end user must ultimately be served through a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
			While making our game, eventually we will have to split our code into multiple files, and it's not viable to use <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for each of them.
			This makes it necessary to have a build (or bundling) step, where all of our small JavaScript files are merged into a single file, which is then served to our players.
		</p>
        <p>
            The tool that does the bundling is called Webpack, and to run it we will first need to install and set up a Node.js project.
