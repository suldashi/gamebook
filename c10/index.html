        <h1>Chapter 10 - Optimizing Collision Detection</h1>
        <p>
            In the previous chapter, we created a simple collision detection system that can detect
            and take action whenever two bodies collide. However, the implementation is slow because
            it has to check every pair of bodies in the system. In this article, we will optimize
            the collision detection system by using a spatial partitioning system. This spatial partitioning
            system will divide the world into a grid of cells, and then only check for collisions
            between bodies in the same cell. This will speed up the collision detection system
            by a factor of about 10 to 100.
        </p>
        <div id="pixi-root"></div>
        <p>
            The key insight behind this optimization is that collisions are not possible between
            bodies that are "far" away. For this reason, if we can determine that two bodies are
            not close enough to each other to possibly collide, we can skip the collision detection
            step. This is called the <em>broad phase</em> of the collision detection system.
        </p>
        <p>
            In comparison, the <em>narrow phase</em> is what actually checks for collisions between
            two bodies. In the previous article, we used the narrow phase exclusively on all pairs
            of bodies. However, in this article we'll show how we can use the broad phase to
            eliminate most of the pairs of bodies that we need to check. Therefore the final
            collision detection system will work by first running the broad phase and placing
            the bodies in different spatial cells. Then, the narrow phase will be run on each
            cell in the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many ways to implement the broad phase. We'll be implementing a uniform
            grid, which is not the most efficient method, but it's still fast enough for most
            games and it's the simplest method. If we get to a point where the uniform grid is
            still not fast enough, there are algorithms such as QuadTree, KDtree, and others
            which we can use. Until then, the uniform grid will serve us well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing we have to decide is the size of the grid. If we make the grid small,
            we will have to check less pairs of bodies, but at the same time we will have to
            spend more and more memory to hold the grid. The reverse is also true, the larger the
            grid the more comparisons between bodies, but less memory used. Because modern computers
            have an abundance of memory, it's best to stay on the safe side and make the grid relatively
            small, a good rule of thumb is to make it roughly two or three times the size of the player
            character.
        </p>
        <p>
            A grid cell is defined by its top-left corner and size. For example, if we have a cell with
            a top-left corner of (0, 0) and a size of 150, we can simply call this cell
            <strong class="code-inline">0|0</strong>, the next cell to the right would be
            <strong class="code-inline">150|0</strong>, and the next cell to the bottom would be
            <strong class="code-inline">150|150</strong>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="gridsize.png" class="image-border" />
            <figcaption class="image-caption">In this screenshot, the player character (on the top-left)
                is 64x64 units large. Each cell in the grid (green) is 150x150 units large.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The next step is to create a function that will calculate which cells does a body
            fit into. Given a BodyComponent, we can calculate the cell (or cells) that the body fits into.
            The body can fit into multiple cells in the case where it is larger than the size of a cell, or
            if it sits between multiple cells.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">function calculateCells(bodyComponent) {
    const cellSize = 150;
    const xCells = [];
    const yCells = [];
    const calculatedCells = [];

    let maxX = Math.ceil((bodyComponent.position.x + bodyComponent.width)/cellSize)*cellSize;
    let maxY = Math.ceil((bodyComponent.position.y + bodyComponent.height)/cellSize)*cellSize;

    for(let x = bodyComponent.position.x; x &lt;= maxX; x+=cellSize) {
        xCells.push(Math.floor(x/cellSize)*cellSize);
    }

    for(let y = bodyComponent.position.y; y &lt;= maxY; y+=cellSize) {
        yCells.push(Math.floor(y/cellSize)*cellSize);
    }

            Using the <strong class="code-inline">calculateCells</strong> function, we can place each
            <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong> in the appropriate cells. This must be
            done during each call of <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem.update()</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once all the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>s are placed in the appropriate cells,
            we iterate
