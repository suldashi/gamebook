        <h1>Chapter 5 - The timestep</h1>
        <p>
            The timestep (or delta time) is the time it takes for one frame of the game loop to finish. If our game loop
            runs at 60 frames per second, then the timestep of our game will be 1/60th of a second,
            which is roughly 16.6666 milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The existence of the timestep has two very important consequences. The first is that when making
            our game, every frame has a time "budget" of 16.6666 milliseconds, meaning that every calculation,
            every rendering on the screen, every piece of code that runs in a frame needs to complete within
            that 16.6666 milliseconds window. If this deadline is missed, the game may slow down, feel choppy,
            or display irregular behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other consequence is that we have to take into account the timestep for every calculation of motion
            in our game. For example, if we have an object that moves at 125 units per second, then this object
            should move at around 2.083333 units per frame. This result is achieved by taking our timestep, which is
            16.6666 milliseconds and converting it into seconds by dividing it by 1000. The result is 0.0166666 seconds
            per frame. Next, we multiply the 125 units per second with the 0.0166666 seconds per frame to get the final
            result of 2.083333 units per frame.
