        <p>
            GitHub Pages is a feature provided for free to all GitHub repositories that provides
            hosting for static sites and JavaScript apps or games. Most JavaScript games that don't use
            a backend or multiplayer features can be easily hosted in such an environment, and it's
            the easiest way to show someone what we've made.

            I use GitHub Pages to host this very book, which is written in pure HTML and JavaScript.
