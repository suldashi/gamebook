        <h1>Collision detection and resolution</h1>
        <p>
            Collision detection refers to all methods that detect when a body is touching another.
            Some examples are checking if a bullet hit an enemy, if a player is touching the floor, if
            we're close enough to talk to an NPC, and many more. This feature is essential in
            a lot of games, and in this article we'll describe how to implement it.
        </p>
        <div id="pixi-root"></div>
        <p>
            When detecting whether two bodies are touching, the method we choose depends on the
            exact shape of the bodies. For better performance, we can choose specific shapes that
            are fast to compute, and it just so happens that the rectangles we've been using are
            such a shape. These are also called AABB (axis aligned bounding box), which means
            the sides of the rectangle are parallel with the <span class="copyable-formula">x</span><math><mi>x</mi></math>
            and <span class="copyable-formula">y</span><math><mi>y</mi></math> axes of the coordinate system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Checking if two rectangles are touching is rather easy. If the rectanagles have an overlap
            in both the <span class="copyable-formula">x</span><math><mi>x</mi></math> and 
            <span class="copyable-formula">y</span><math><mi>y</mi></math> axes, then they overlap.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="rects.svg" class="image-border" />
            <figcaption class="image-caption">Two rectangles are said to overlap in either the
                <span class="copyable-formula">x</span><math><mi>x</mi></math> or
                <span class="copyable-formula">y</span><math><mi>y</mi></math> axis
                if the edges of one rectangles is between the two edges of the other rectangle.
                In this figure, the four possible cases are shown: no overlap in either axis, overlap in the
                <span class="copyable-formula">x</span><math><mi>x</mi></math> axis only, overlap in the
                <span class="copyable-formula">y</span><math><mi>y</mi></math> axis only, and overlap in both the
                <span class="copyable-formula">x</span><math><mi>x</mi></math> and
                <span class="copyable-formula">y</span><math><mi>y</mi></math> axes.
                In the final case when there's overlap in both axes the rectangles are visibly one on top of the other.

        <p>
            Let's make a function that check the overlap of two bodies. Given two <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong>
            instances <strong class="code-inline">b1</strong> and <strong class="code-inline">b2</strong>,
            the <strong class="code-inline">checkOverlap</strong> function will return true or false
            depending if they overlap or not.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">function checkOverlap(b1, b2) {
    if (b1.position.x + b1.width &lt; b2.position.x ||    // if the right edge of b1 is to the left of the left edge of b2
        b1.position.x &gt; b2.position.x + b2.width ||    // if the left edge of b1 is to the right of the right edge of b2
        b1.position.y + b1.height &lt; b2.position.y ||   // if the bottom edge of b1 is above the top edge of b2
        b1.position.y &gt; b2.position.y + b2.height) {    // if the top edge of b1 is below the bottom edge of b2
        return false;                                    // then there's no overlap
    }
    return true;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The above code is actually a great example of a logical transformation. The following statements
            are equivalent, so we can use any of them as the basis for our function:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Assume the rectangles don't intersect. If one edge of a rectagle in an axis sits between the
                    two edges of the other rectangle, we have a overlap in that axis. If we have an overlap in
                    both axes, the rectangles intersect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assume the rectangles intersect. If there is any axis where there is no overlap, then
                    the rectangles don't intersect.
                </li>
            </ul>
            It turns out the second options is easier to program, easier to understand, and more performant,
            therefore the code above represents the second option.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have our function, we can put it in a system and use it with an appropriate component.
            Let's create a directory called <strong class="code-inline">collision</strong> and as usual,
            let's create the component first, name it <strong class="code-inline">collisionComponent.js</strong>,
            and let's also put the following code there:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import Component from "../ecs/component";

export default class CollisionComponent extends Component {
    constructor(bodyComponent, collisionTag) {
        super();
        this.bodyComponent = bodyComponent;
        this.collisionTag = collisionTag;
        this.collisionCallbacks = {}
    }

    setCollisionCallback(targetCollisionTag, callback) {
        this.collisionCallbacks[targetCollisionTag] = callback;
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
        Compared to the components in the previous chapters, the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>
        has a few additional properties that are worth mentioning, the first being the
        <strong class="code-inline">collisionTag</strong>. This is a string that is attached
        to a <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong> and is used to differentiate
        the types of objects that will be colliding, for example <strong class="code-inline">player</strong>,
        <strong class="code-inline">enemy</strong>, <strong class="code-inline">food</strong>,
        <strong class="code-inline">poison</strong>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second important property is the <strong class="code-inline">setCollisionCallback</strong> method.
        With this method we can set a callback that will trigger when the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>
        overlaps with another <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong> that has
        a <strong class="code-inline">collisionTag</strong> equal to <strong class="code-inline">targetCollisionTag</strong>.
        These callbacks are stored in the <strong class="code-inline">collisionCallbacks</strong> object.
    </p>
    <p>
        The approach of using <strong class="code-inline">collisionTag</strong> gives us two primary benefits.
        The first is that it allows us to have different behavior when colliding with objects of different tags.
        The second is that we can optimize the performance of the entire <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem</strong>
        by skipping any two bodies with tags that don't have registered callbacks. For example, if nothing is supposed
        to happen when a body tagged with <strong class="code-inline">food</strong> touches
        another body tagged with <strong class="code-inline">food</strong>, then we can just skip the comparison
        between these bodies. This optimization will be explored in a later chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem</strong> is what will actually be doing the overlap checks
        between the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong> pairs. The code looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">import System from "../ecs/system";
import CollisionComponent from "./collisionComponent";

export default class CollisionSystem extends System {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }

    update() {
        const collisionInstances = [];
        for(let i = 0; i &lt; this.components.length - 1; i++) {
            for(let j = i + 1; j &lt; this.components.length; j++) {
                if(checkOverlap(this.components[i].bodyComponent, this.components[j].bodyComponent)) {
                    if(this.components[i].collisionCallbacks[this.components[j].collisionTag]) {
                        collisionInstances.push(this.components[i].collisionCallbacks[this.components[j].collisionTag]);
                    }
                    if(this.components[j].collisionCallbacks[this.components[i].collisionTag]) {
                        collisionInstances.push(this.components[j].collisionCallbacks[this.components[i].collisionTag]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        for(let collisionInstance of collisionInstances) {
            collisionInstance();
        }
    }

    createCollisionComponent(bodyComponent, collisionTag) {
        let collisionComponent = new CollisionComponent(bodyComponent, collisionTag);
        this.components.push(collisionComponent);
        return collisionComponent;
    }
}

function checkOverlap(b1, b2) {
    if (b1.position.x + b1.width &lt; b2.position.x ||
        b1.position.x &gt; b2.position.x + b2.width ||
        b1.position.y + b1.height &lt; b2.position.y ||
        b1.position.y &gt; b2.position.y + b2.height) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
        Like before, we can use the <strong class="code-inline">checkOverlap</strong> function to check if two bodies overlap.
        However, this time it has been integrated into the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem</strong>.
        Importantly, the system checks all the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong> pairs,
        and if they overlap, the corresponding callbacks are scheduled to be called after all pairs are checked.
        This is done by storing the callbacks in the <strong class="code-inline">collisionInstances</strong> array,
        and then calling them all once all pairs have been checked.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason why we don't call the callback immediately is that we want to make sure that the callback does
        not change the state of the game, for example, by removing a body, or by changing the position of a body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's imagine a scenario where a player touches two powerups at the same time, one that gives the player
        a boost, and the other teleports the player to a new location. If we touch both powerups at the same time,
        there is no way to know which one will be called first. If we call the boost powerup first, then the
        teleport powerup will be called after the boost powerup, and the player will get both powerups. On the other
        hand, if we call the teleport powerup first, the player will be teleported away, and by the time the
        collision between the player and the boost is checked, they will no longer be touching and the player will
        not get the boost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Behavior like the one described above is a great source of subtle and arbitrary bugs. The order in which
        we iterate through the pairs of <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>s is unpredictable,
        and can depend upon many factors outside of our control. We must always be on the lookout for these
        situations and make sure that our engine is both predictable and consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important to note is that by since we're comparing each pair of <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>s,
        the number of comparisons is roughly equal to the square of the number of <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>s.
        This number quickly becomes large, even with as little as 20-30 <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>s
        there will be 400-900 comparisons. For this reason, we'll be improving and optimizing this code in the next chapter.
        However, for demonstration purposes or for small examples the current code is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since collision detection is used extensively in a game, it's important to make it fast. Luckily,
        there are plenty of opportunities to optimize the code. In the next chapter, we'll apply some
        optimizations to the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem</strong> that will make it
        significantly faster.
