        <h1>Optimizing Collision Detection</h1>
        <p>
            In the previous chapter, we created a simple collision detection system that can detect
            and take action whenever two bodies collide. However, the implementation is slow because
            it has to check every pair of bodies in the system. In this article, we will optimize
            the collision detection system by using a spatial partitioning system. This spatial partitioning
            system will divide the world into a grid of cells, and then only check for collisions
            between bodies in the same cell. In practice, this will speed up the collision detection
            system by a factor of about 10 to 100.
        </p>
        <div id="pixi-root"></div>
        <figcaption class="image-caption">Above, each cell is highlighted and the number of bodies
            within is printed in the center.
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            The key insight behind this optimization is that collisions are not possible between
            bodies that are "far" away. For this reason, if we can determine that two bodies are
            not close enough to each other to possibly collide, we can skip the collision detection
            step. This is called the <em>broad phase</em> of the collision detection system.
        </p>
        <p>
            In comparison, the <em>narrow phase</em> is what actually checks for collisions between
            two bodies. In the previous article, we used the narrow phase exclusively on all pairs
            of bodies. However, in this article we'll show how we can use the broad phase to
            eliminate most of the pairs of bodies that we need to check. Therefore the final
            collision detection system will work by first running the broad phase and placing
            the bodies in different spatial cells. Then, the narrow phase will be run on each
            cell in the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many ways to implement the broad phase. We'll be implementing a uniform
            grid, which is not the most efficient method, but it's still fast enough for most
            games and it's the simplest method. If we get to a point where the uniform grid is
            still not fast enough, there are algorithms such as QuadTree, KDtree, and others
            which we can use. Until then, the uniform grid will serve us well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing we have to decide is the size of the grid. If we make the grid small,
            we will have to check less pairs of bodies, but at the same time we will have to
            spend more and more memory to hold the grid. The reverse is also true, the larger the
            grid the more comparisons between bodies, but less memory used. Because modern computers
            have an abundance of memory, it's best to stay on the safe side and make the grid relatively
            small, a good rule of thumb is to make it roughly two or three times the size of the player
            character.
        </p>
        <p>
            A grid cell is defined by its top-left corner and size. For example, if we have a cell with
            a top-left corner of (0, 0) and a size of 150, we can simply call this cell
            <strong class="code-inline">0|0</strong>, the next cell to the right would be
            <strong class="code-inline">150|0</strong>, and the next cell to the bottom would be
            <strong class="code-inline">150|150</strong>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="gridsize.png" class="image-border" />
            <figcaption class="image-caption">In this screenshot, the player character (on the top-left)
                is 64x64 units large. Each cell in the grid (green) is 150x150 units large.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The next step is to create a function that will calculate which cells does a body
            fit into. Given a BodyComponent, we can calculate the cell (or cells) that the body fits into.
            The body can fit into multiple cells in the case where it is larger than the size of a cell, or
            if it sits between multiple cells.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">function calculateCells(bodyComponent) {
    const cellSize = 150;
    const xCells = [];
    const yCells = [];
    const calculatedCells = [];

    let maxX = Math.ceil((bodyComponent.position.x + bodyComponent.width)/cellSize)*cellSize;
    let maxY = Math.ceil((bodyComponent.position.y + bodyComponent.height)/cellSize)*cellSize;

    for(let x = bodyComponent.position.x; x &lt;= maxX; x+=cellSize) {
        xCells.push(Math.floor(x/cellSize)*cellSize);
    }

    for(let y = bodyComponent.position.y; y &lt;= maxY; y+=cellSize) {
        yCells.push(Math.floor(y/cellSize)*cellSize);
    }
    
    for(let i = 0;i&lt;xCells.length;i++) {
        for(let j = 0;j&lt;yCells.length;j++) {
            calculatedCells.push(`${xCells[i]}|${yCells[j]}`);
        }
    }

    return calculatedCells;
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Using the <strong class="code-inline">calculateCells</strong> function, we can place each
            <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong> in the appropriate cells. This must be
            done during each call of <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem.update()</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once all the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionComponent</strong>s are placed in the appropriate cells,
            we iterate through each cell and check for collisions between bodies within each cell. Since the expected number
            of bodies inside a cell is relatively small, this is much faster than naively iterating through all
            bodies in the system. Also important to note is that the behavior and signature of the 
            <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem</strong> is the same as what we had before, so we can
            simply replace the old class with the new and it will work as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, there is one bug we have introduced that we have to fix before it's a true replacement.
            If a body is placed in two cells, it will be checked against all bodies in both cells. This is
            expected, but if yet another body is placed in the same two cells, then the same pair of bodies
            will be checked twice, the collision will be detected twice, and the collision callback will
            called twice. This is not what we want, and the way to fix it is to keep a list of pairs that
            we've already checked and only check pairs that are not in this list.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code for the complete system is as follows:
        </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">import System from "../ecs/system";

                    cells[cellKey] = [];
                }

    <p>
        The system we just showed is organized as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In line 54, we define the <strong class="code-inline">calculateCells</strong> function,
        which calculates which cells does a body fit into</li>
        <li>In lines 14 - 22, we take each body and place them in the appropriate cells using the 
            <strong class="code-inline">calculateCells</strong> function</li>
        <li>In lines 24 - 40, we iterate through each cell, and check each pair of bodies
            in that cell for collisions. If a collision is detected, we add the collision callback to the
            <strong class="code-inline">collisions</strong> array.</li>
        <li>In line 29 we add the pair to the list of already checked collisions, to ensure that the same
            pair of bodies is not checked twice. The actual check is done in line 27.</li>
        <li>In lines 42 - 44, we apply the collision callbacks that we stored earlier in the 
            <strong class="code-inline">collisions</strong> array.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At this point, our updates to the <strong class="code-inline">CollisionSystem</strong> are complete.
        We can replace the old implemetation with the new one and we'll get a significant performance boost.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are still two optimizations we can make to improve the performance even more. The first is 
        to only check bodies if there are collision callbacks registered for it. For example, if we don't
        have any callbacks registered when a food touches a poison, we don't need to compare this pair.
        The second optimization is to only update the cells when the bodies inside them move. If a body
        did not move, we can be sure that it will still fit in the same cells as before, so we can just
        store these and use them again. These optimizations are left as an exercise to the reader.
