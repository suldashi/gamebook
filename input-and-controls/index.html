        <h1>Input and controls</h1>
        <p>
            An essential element of any video game is input, typically through a keyboard, mouse,
            controller, or touch screen. In this article we'll explore the basics of keyboard
            input and implement an example.
        </p>
        
        <div id="pixi-root"></div>
        <p><em>Press the WASD keys to move the square</em></p>
        <p>
            Anytime we interact with a web page, the page generates (or fires) a JavaScript
            <em>event</em>. By attaching an <em>event handler</em> to the page, we can capture the
            events and take the appropriate actions in our game. For handling keyboard input, the
            most important events are the <strong class="code-inline">keydown</strong> event, which
            is fired when a button on the keyboard is pressed, and the <strong class="code-inline">keyup</strong>
            event, which is fired when a key is released. Naturally, when we press and release a
            key, first the <strong class="code-inline">keydown</strong> event will be fired first, and then
            <strong class="code-inline">keyup</strong> right after.
        </p>
        <p>
            To capture these events, we must register callbacks on the global
            <strong class="code-inline">window.onkeydown</strong> and
            <strong class="code-inline">window.onkeyup</strong> properties. To try it out, add the
            following code anywhere on your page:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">window.onkeydown = (ev) =&gt; {
    console.log("PRESSED", ev);
};

window.onkeyup = (ev) =&gt; {
    console.log("RELEASED", ev);
};</code></pre>
        <p>
            The generated events have a few interesting properties that we are very interested
            in. In particular, the <strong class="code-inline">code</strong> property is the one we need to
            examine, since it contains a string that represents the exact physical key that was pressed. For
            example, when we press the the <em>W</em> key, the event <strong class="code-inline">code</strong>
            property will have a value of <strong class="code-inline">KeyW</strong>.
        </p>

            <img src="kbevent.png" class="image-border" />
            <figcaption class="image-caption">The browser's console after 6 events, three <em>keydown</em>
                and three <em>keyup</em> events. Examining the properties shows that we pressed the <em>D</em>
                key twice and then the <em>S</em> key once.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Now that we can detect which key has been pressed or released, we can start integrating keyboard
            controls in our game. We'll use the ECS pattern which was described earlier. Let's create an
            <strong class="code-inline">input</strong> directory, and in that directory let's also create
            a <strong class="code-inline">keyboardInputComponent.js</strong> file. In this file let's put
            the following code:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import Component from '../ecs/component';

export default class KeyboardInputComponent extends Component {
    constructor(bodyComponent) {
        super();
        this.bodyComponent = bodyComponent;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            There not much here to explain except that the <strong class="code-inline">KeyboardInputComponent</strong>
            has a <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> as a dependency. This is the
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> that we'll be moving using the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            The component we just created will also need an appropriate system to handle it. Let's create a
            <strong class="code-inline">keyboardInputSystem.js</strong> file with the following code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import System from '../ecs/system';
import Vec2 from '../vec2';
import KeyboardInputComponent from './keyboardInputComponent';

export default class KeyboardInputSystem extends System {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.up = false;
        this.down = false;
        this.left = false;
        this.right = false;
        window.onkeydown = (event) => {
            if(event.code === "KeyW") {
                this.up = true;
            }
            else if(event.code === "KeyS") {
                this.down = true;
            }
            else if(event.code === "KeyA") {
                this.left = true;
            }
            else if(event.code === "KeyD") {
                this.right = true;
            }
        };
        window.onkeyup = (event) => {
            if(event.code === "KeyW") {
                this.up = false;
            }
            else if(event.code === "KeyS") {
                this.down = false;
            }
            else if(event.code === "KeyA") {
                this.left = false;
            }
            else if(event.code === "KeyD") {
                this.right = false;
            }
        };
    }

    update() {
        for(const component of this.components) {
            let horVelocity = 0;
            let verVelocity = 0;
            let velocityValue = 200;
            if(this.left && !this.right) {
                horVelocity = -velocityValue;
            }
            else if(!this.left && this.right) {
                horVelocity = velocityValue;
            }
            if(this.up && !this.down) {
                verVelocity = -velocityValue;
            }
            else if(!this.up && this.down) {
                verVelocity = velocityValue;
            }
            component.bodyComponent.velocity = new Vec2(horVelocity, verVelocity);
        }
    }

    createKeyboardInputComponent(bodyComponent) {
        const component = new KeyboardInputComponent(bodyComponent);
        this.components.push(component);
        return component;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Let's go over the code and explain how it all works. Lines 8-11 contain the state of the controls,
            meaning we can examine these variables and immediately know which buttons are currently pressed or not.
            These variables also have names that are meaningful in our game, and represent which
            direction can the square move.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lines 12-39 contain the two event handlers. Both work similarly, they check the
            <strong class="code-inline">code</strong> value of the event and set the appropriate
            variable to true or false.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lines 44-59 are the ones that set the velocity of the moving body. If 
            <strong class="code-inline">this.left</strong> is <em>true</em> and
            <strong class="code-inline">this.right</strong> is <em>false</em>, we give the body
            a negative horizontal velocity (move it to the left) and vice versa. Similarly,
            if <strong class="code-inline">this.up</strong> is <em>true</em> and
            <strong class="code-inline">this.down</strong> is <em>false</em>, we give the body
            a negative vertical velocity (move it upwards) and vice versa. We can set both the
            horizontal and vertical directions independently, which allows us to move diagonally
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're now ready to use this system and component in our game. Let's update the
            <strong class="code-inline">index.js</strong> by putting the following code there:  
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import * as MainLoop from 'mainloop.js';
import KeyboardInputSystem from './input/keyboardInputSystem';
import PhysicsSystem from './physics/physicsSystem';
import GraphicsSystem from './graphics/graphicsSystem';
import Entity from './ecs/entity';
import config from './config';

let keyboardInputSystem = new KeyboardInputSystem();
let physicsSystem = new PhysicsSystem();
let graphicsSystem = new GraphicsSystem();

createPlayerRectangle(config.width / 2, config.height / 2);

MainLoop.setUpdate((delta) => {
    const deltaInSecs = delta / 1000;
    keyboardInputSystem.update();
    physicsSystem.update(deltaInSecs);

    keyboardInputSystem.deleteStaleComponents();
    physicsSystem.deleteStaleComponents();
}).setDraw(() => {
    graphicsSystem.update();
    
    graphicsSystem.deleteStaleComponents();
});

MainLoop.start();

function createPlayerRectangle(posX, posY) {
    let entity = new Entity();
    let bodyComponent = physicsSystem.createBodyComponent(posX, posY);
    let graphicsComponent = graphicsSystem.createGraphicsComponent(bodyComponent);
    let keyboardInputComponent = keyboardInputSystem.createKeyboardInputComponent(bodyComponent);
    entity.attachComponents(bodyComponent, graphicsComponent, keyboardInputComponent);
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The important thing to note in the above code is that the <strong class="code-inline">keyboardInputSystem</strong>
            is the first thing that runs in each frame. If we handle the controls at a later time, we could run into
            the situation where some parts of the game loop run with old controls and some with
            new ones. If the controls are handled at the end of the loop, they'll always be at least
            one frame behind, making our game a bit unresponsive, and for this reason the controls
            are always handled first.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're almost ready to make a complete game. In the next chapter, we'll explore how
            to handle cases when two bodies touch each other and what do to when that happens.
