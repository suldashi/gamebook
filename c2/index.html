        <h1>Chapter 2 - Bundling and distributing JavaScript code using Webpack</h1>
        <p>
			In a web browser context, all JavaScript code that needs to be executed by the end user must ultimately be served through a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
			While making our game, eventually we will have to split our code into multiple files, and it's not viable to use <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for each of them.
			This makes it necessary to have a build (or bundling) step, where all of our small JavaScript files are merged into a single file, which is then served to our players.
