        <h1>Chapter 6 - Physics and motion</h1>
        <p>
            Earlier we created a rectangle that bounces around the game scene. In this article
            we'll explore moving objects in depth and how we can get them to consistently follow the rules
            of physics.

            In game development, physics refers to all systems and methods that are used to move objects
            in the game world. Physics systems can be as simple as only including velocity and acceleration,
            all the way to realistic simulations that take into account wind, friction, deformation, rotation,
            and many other phenomena. For the moment we'll be focusing on the most basic systems that only use
            velocity and acceleration.
