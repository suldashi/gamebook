        <h1>Why make our own game engine?</h1>
        <p>
            When deciding to make a video game, one of the most common pieces of advice is to not
            make a custom engine, but to use an already available commercial or open-source engine.
            This is good advice for many people, and the main reason is that making an engine costs
            a lot of time and money, which could be spent making the gameplay features instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why then do we want to write our own engine? The main reason is that a custom engine allows
            us to implement unique features and capabilities. On the <a href="../aesthetic-principles/">
            Aesthetic Principles</a> section I mentioned some of the goals of the engine, but that's
            not the same thing as the goals of the game itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game I want to make is a 2D shooter, with real-time multiplayer, that loads instantly
            and can be played by anyone without creating an account or downloading anything. Also, I
            want to allow the players to change the parameters of the game, such as weapon
            damage, level layout, and even victory conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's no engine available that has those features, and that's why we'll have to make one.
