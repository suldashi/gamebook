        <h1>Hello World and basic setup</h1>
        <h3>In this chapter, we'll set up our development environment and essential tools.</h3>
        <p>
            The first step in starting our project is to install Node.js. <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/">You can download Node.js from
            the official website by clicking here,</a> and then install it on your computer by following the provided instructions. Node.js
            also comes bundled with a package manager called <strong class="code-inline">npm</strong> which we'll use to install our dependencies and set up the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once Node.js has been installed, create a directory for your project, navigate to it using the command line and run the following command:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">npm init</code></pre>
        <p>
            Follow the prompts and give your project a name of your choice along with some other basic details.
            If the initialization was successful, you should see a file called <strong class="code-inline">package.json</strong> in the project's directory.
            This file contains the essentail information about your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we will create the <strong class="code-inline">index.html</strong> file. This file will be the webpage that
            hosts the game we're making. Put the following code in the <strong class="code-inline">index.html</strong> file:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Check out my awesome JavaScript game!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello world, we're making a JavaScript video game!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;script src="bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            Note how we're importing the <strong class="code-inline">bundle.js</strong> file at the bottom of the <strong class="code-inline">index.html</strong> file.
            Let's create it now, and add the following content to it:
        </p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const greeting = "Welcome to our JavaScript game!";
alert(greeting);</code></pre>
        <p>
            Finally, to serve the files we created to our users we'll need a suitable web server. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">
            A good option for our use is <strong class="code-inline">http-server</strong></a>, and we can install it easily on our project by typing the following command in our terminal:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">npm install http-server</code></pre>
        <p>
            Once <strong class="code-inline">http-server</strong> is installed, we're ready to run our project. We can do that by typing this command in the terminal:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">npx http-server</code></pre>
        <p>
            If the server was started successfully, we can finally see our project in action. Open your web browser, and navigate to
            <a href="http://localhost:8080"><strong class="code-inline">http://localhost:8080</strong></a>.
            If you see someting similar to the screenshot below, congratulations, you've successfully set up the base on which we'll build our game!
        </p>

        <p>
            If you examine the project directory, you will find the newly-created <strong class="code-inline">node_modules</strong>
            directory and the <strong class="code-inline">package-lock.json</strong> file.
            <strong class="code-inline">node_modules</strong> is where the packages installed by <strong class="code-inline">npm</strong>
            are stored, and the <strong class="code-inline">package-lock.json</strong> file is where detailed information about the
            installed packagesis stored. For the most part we won't need to ever interact with
            <strong class="code-inline">node_modules</strong> or <strong class="code-inline">package-lock.json</strong> directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next chapter we will set up Webpack, which allows us to bundle multiple JavaScript into one single bundled file which is
            suitable for distribution to our users.
