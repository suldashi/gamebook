        <h1>Chapter 4 - The game loop</h1>
        <p>
            In a video game, the game loop is how the game advances forward in time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The game loop is a type of infinite loop, and during each repetition (also called a frame),
            it takes input from the player, updates the world, and renders the results. However, instead of running
            as fast as possible like a <strong class="code-inline">while(true) { ... }</strong> loop, the game
            loop runs at a predictable and fixed interval called a timestep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing our own game loop from scratch is a difficult and unnecessary process when we can get a
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mainloop.js" target="_blank">high quality implementation called <strong class="code-inline">mainloop.js</strong></a>
            from <strong class="code-inline">npm</strong>. Type the following command to install it on our project:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">npm install mainloop.js</code></pre>
        <p>Don't forget to bundle</p>
