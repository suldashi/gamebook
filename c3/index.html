        <h1>Chapter 3 - Introduction to computer graphics using Pixi.js</h1>
        <p>
			Almost every video game needs to display something to the screen so that the player
            can see the game (the Latin root word of video – <em>videre</em>, means to see). In this article we’ll
            explain the basics of display systems and how to draw basic shapes on the screen. These basic
            shapes will be the fundamental building blocks of all interactive elements in any video game.

            JavaScript on the web offers many different ways of drawing 2D shapes and graphics on the screen, but
            one of the best ways to do it is by using the <a target="_blank" href="https://pixijs.com/"><code>pixi.js</code></a> library. We can 
            install <code>pixi.js</code> by typing the following command in the terminal:
        </p>
        <pre class="codeblock">npm install pixi.js</pre>
