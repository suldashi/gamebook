        <h1>The game loop</h1>
        <p>
            In a video game, the game loop is how the game advances forward in time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The game loop is a type of infinite loop, and during each repetition (also called a frame),
            it takes input from the player, updates the world, and renders the results. However, instead of running
            as fast as possible like a <strong class="code-inline">while(true) { ... }</strong> loop, the game
            loop runs at a predictable and fixed interval called a timestep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing our own game loop from scratch is a difficult and unnecessary process when we can get a
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mainloop.js" target="_blank">high quality implementation called
            <strong class="code-inline">mainloop.js</strong></a> from <strong class="code-inline">npm</strong>.
            Type the following command to install it on our project:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">npm install mainloop.js</code></pre>
        <p>
            Once <strong class="code-inline">mainloop.js</strong> installed, we can import it similarly to how we
            imported PIXI. We also have access to the <strong class="code-inline">MainLoop.setUpdate()</strong> function,
            here we can set the callback that will be called each frame. In addition, we can call the 
            <strong class="code-inline">MainLoop.start()</strong> function to get the loop working.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following code is responsible for the effect at the start of the article. We've defined a colored rectangle
            which moves diagonally, and when it reaches the edges of the scene, it will switch directions away from the edge
            while at the same time getting a new color.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
import * as MainLoop from 'mainloop.js';

let xVelocity = 1;
let yVelocity = 1;

let xPosition = 60;
let yPosition = 120;

const gameWidth = 640;
const gameHeight = 360;

const rectWidth = 200;
const rectHeight = 100;
let rectColor = randomColor();

const app = new PIXI.Application({ width: gameWidth, height: gameHeight });
document.body.appendChild(app.view);

const obj = new PIXI.Graphics();
app.stage.addChild(obj);
MainLoop.setUpdate(() => {
obj.clear();
obj.beginFill(rectColor);
obj.drawRect(xPosition, yPosition, rectWidth, rectHeight);
xPosition += xVelocity;
yPosition += yVelocity;
if(xPosition + rectWidth === gameWidth) {
    xVelocity = -1;
    rectColor = randomColor();
}
if(xPosition === 0) {
    xVelocity = 1;
    rectColor = randomColor();
}
if(yPosition + rectHeight === gameHeight) {
    yVelocity = -1;
    rectColor = randomColor();
}
if(yPosition === 0) {
    yVelocity = 1;
    rectColor = randomColor();
}
});

MainLoop.start();

function randomColor() {
let red = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
let green = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
let blue = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
return (red &lt;&lt; 16) + (green &lt;&lt; 8) + blue;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Let's go through the code an explain some of the new things we added:
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 2, we're importing <strong class="code-inline">mainloop.js</strong> and assigning it
            into a variable called <strong class='code-inline'>MainLoop</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In lines 4 and 5, we're defining a horizontal and vertical velocity for our rectangle. It's
            important to take note of the units, the values 1 here mean 1 pixel per frame. In a following
            article we'll be examining this in more detail, and how we can move to more natural units such
            as meters per second.
        </p>
        <p>
            In lines 7 and 8 we define the horizontal and vertical position of the rectangle. Much like the
            entire scene, the rectangle also has an origin point, and it also is defined as the top-left corner
            (vertex) of the rectangle. This means that at the start of the scene the rectangle's top-left corner
            will be 60 pixels away from the left of the scene, and 120 pixels away from top of the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 10 and 11 we've defined the width and height of the scene. Similarly, in lines 13 and 14
            we have defined the width and height of the rectangle. Note the <strong class='code-inline'>const</strong>
            keyword, these values will not change while the loop is running.
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 15 we're defining the color of the rectangle. Note how we're calling a function called
            <strong class="code-inline">randomColor()</strong> which is defined in line 48. This function generates
            a random RGB color every time it's called.
        </p>
        <p>
            Importantly, in line 22 we call the <strong class="code-inline">MainLoop.setUpdate()</strong> function,
            where we define a callback that is called every frame. Normally a large portion of a game's code is
            inside such a function, since the game needs to advance forward to be able to give the illusion of motion.
            By default, the callback is called 60 times per second, or 60 fps (frames per second).
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside the callback, in line 23 we clear all geometric shapes that already exist in the scene. This is an
            important step since if we don't do it the shapes from previous frames will still be in the scene when we
            want to draw something new. For this reason, in every frame it's a good idea to clear the whole scene
            and start fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 24, we set the rectangle's color to the random color we defined earlier. In line 25 we draw the rectangle
            on the positions defined by <strong class='code-inline'>xPosition</strong> and <strong class='code-inline'>yPosition</strong>.
            Important to note that these variables change their value every frame, so every frame the position of the rectangle will be
            different than the last.
        </p>
        <p>
            The changing of the <strong class='code-inline'>xPosition</strong> and <strong class='code-inline'>yPosition</strong> happens
            in lines 26 and 27. If at the start of the scene the value of <strong class='code-inline'>xPosition</strong> is 200, in
            the next frame it will be 201, the one after that 202, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lines 28 through 43 define the functionality of the rectangle bouncing from the edges of the scene. In
            all these cases we set a new value for <strong class='code-inline'>rectColor</strong>, meaning that
            every time the rectangle touches one of the walls it will get a new random color.
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 28, we check if the right side of the rectangle touches the right side of the scene. Because
            the <strong class='code-inline'>xPosition</strong> defines the left edge of the rectangle, we need to
            add the <strong class='code-inline'>rectWidth</strong> to it to get the position of the right edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 32 we check if the left side of the rectangle touches the left side of the scene. In our case
            the left side of the scene is defined as 0, and this check is simpler than the one for the right side.
        </p>
        <p>
            In line 36 we do a similar check to the one in line 28, but this time it's for the vertical direction.
            If the bottom of the rectangle touches the bottom of the scene, the <strong class='code-inline'>yVelocity</strong>
            is set to -1, and in the next frame the rectangle will start to move upward instead of downward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again in line 40 we check if the top of the rectangle touches the top of the scene, and if so, set the
            <strong class='code-inline'>yVelocity</strong> to 1. In the next frame the rectangle will start to move
            downward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally in line 46 we call <strong class='code-inline'>MainLoop.start()</strong> which starts the game loop.
            This loop will run continously until we either stop it or close the page.
