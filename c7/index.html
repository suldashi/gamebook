        <h1>Chapter 7 - The Entity-Component-System pattern</h1>
        <p>
            The Entity-Component-System (ECS) is an architectural pattern that is particularly
            suited to video game development. In this article we'll explain the benefits of
            using ECS and demonstrate a basic implementation using several systems and components.
        </p>
        <div id="pixi-root"></div>
        <p>
            In classic Object-oriented programming (OOP), a computer program is designed around objects,
            which contain all the data and logic needed for their operation. These objects are
            usually defined through classes, which serve as templates for creating many objects
            of the same type. To enable code reuse, classes may inherit from each other, taking
            on all the attributes and functionality of their parent class. However, because game
            classes can have very complex behavior, they may need to inherit from many parent
            classes at different stages, making it difficult to reason about
            the inner workings of classes or extend them without risking breaking functionality
            somewhere else. In addition, multiple inheritance is very complex, making lateral
            code reuse difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            In keeping with the principle of favoring composition over inheritance, ECS takes
            a completely different approach where instead of objects having complete control of
            their internal behavior, the elements of a game are instead organized into <em>entities</em>.
            Every "thing" in our game is an entity, and by default entities don't have any behavior,
            but are just a collection of <em>components</em>.
            Components are pieces of data that can be attached to an entity. Attaching a component
            to an entity will give the entity whatever functionality the component is responsible for.
            Components are matched to particular <em>systems</em>, and each system controls the logic
            and behavior for a specific aspect of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's demonstrate the ECS pattern by refactoring the bouncing ball demo we had in a previous
            article.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll begin by creating our base <strong class="code-inline">Entity</strong>,
            <strong class="code-inline">Component</strong>, and <strong class="code-inline">System</strong> classes.
            All other components and systems will inherit from these base classes. We'll start by creating the
            <strong class="code-inline">ecs</strong> directory. In this directory,
            let's also create the <strong class="code-inline">entity.js</strong> and put the following code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">export default class Entity {
    constructor() {
        this.id = crypto.randomUUID();
        this.components = [];
    }

    attachComponents(...components) {
        this.components = [...this.components, ...components];
    }

    deleteComponents() {
        for(const component of this.components) {
            component.delete();
        }
        this.components = [];
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            From the code, we can see than an entity is nothing but a collection of components. We can associate a component with
            an entity by calling the entity's <strong class="code-inline">attachComponents()</strong> method. Unlike in
            Object-oriented Programming where we can easily delete objects, deleting entities is a bit harder since its
            components are loosely coupled and have to be deleted individually. For this reason the
            <strong class="code-inline">Component</strong> class supports the <strong class="code-inline">delete()</strong>
            method, and the <strong class="code-inline">Entity</strong> class has the <strong class="code-inline">deleteComponents()</strong>
            method which will iterate across all attached components and call their <strong class="code-inline">delete()</strong>
            method one by one. Finally, an entity also has an <strong class="code-inline">id</strong>, allowing us to uniquely
            identify any instance of the <strong class="code-inline">Entity</strong> class from another.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the <strong class="code-inline">ecs</strong> directory, let's also create the <strong class="code-inline">
            component.js</strong> file and put the following code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">export default class Component {
    constructor() {
        this.id = crypto.randomUUID();
        this.isDeleted = false;
    }

    delete() {
        this.isDeleted = true;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            One important thing to note for the <strong class="code-inline">Component</strong> class is that calling
            its <strong class="code-inline">delete()</strong> method only sets the <strong class="code-inline">isDeleted = true</strong>,
            and it's the responsibility of the system that created the component to also safely delete it at the right time.
            Generally we want to delete components at the end of a frame once everything else has been processed. Like
            the <strong class="code-inline">Entity</strong>, each instance of the
            <strong class="code-inline">Component</strong> class also has an <strong class="code-inline">id</strong>, and
            while we're not using the <strong class="code-inline">id</strong> at the moment, it will be very useful in later chapters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, let's also also create the <strong class="code-inline">
            system.js</strong> file in the <strong class="code-inline">ecs</strong> directory, and put the following code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">export default class System {
    constructor() {
        this.components = [];
    }

    update() {
        // nothing here for now
    }

    deleteStaleComponents() {
        this.components = this.components.filter(x => !x.isDeleted);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            By itself the <strong class="code-inline">System</strong> class does nothing, but do note the
            <strong class="code-inline">components</strong> variable, which hints that the system that
            creates a component also manages it. The <strong class="code-inline">update()</strong> method
            is also empty, but all other systems that inherit from this base class will override this method
            to implement the core functionality of the system. It's important to note that this method
            will be called by the game loop every frame, and this is how we'll drive the behavior of the entire
            game engine. Finally, the <strong class="code-inline">deleteStaleComponents</strong> removes
            from the list all components that have been set as deleted. This method will be called at the end
            of each frame.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we've created our base ECS classes, it's time to create a few more that will implement the
            rules of the game. We'll first need to identify the  behaviors that were manifested by the bouncing ball.
            The ball had three distinct behaviors: <ul>
                <li>The ball had a position on the game world and moved according to velocity and acceleration</li>
                <li>The ball was rendered in the screen with a particular color and shape</li>
                <li>The ball bounced and changed color whenever it reached the edges of the game world</li>
            </ul>
            We'll need a system and its corresponding component for each of these behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first component we'll create is the <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong>. Let's
            create a <strong class="code-inline">physics</strong> directory, create a
            <strong class="code-inline">bodyComponent.js</strong> file in this directory and
            put the following code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import Component from '../ecs/component';
import Vec2 from '../vec2';

export default class BodyComponent extends Component {
    constructor(posX, posY) {
        super();
        this.position = new Vec2(posX, posY);
        this.velocity = new Vec2(200, 0);
        this.acceleration = new Vec2(0, 500);
        this.radius = 50;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Like we mentioned earlier, components hold data for some aspect of our entities, in this case
            data about the physical aspects of the entity. The acceleration and velocity have been hardcoded
            to match the behavior of the previous article, but can be changed to whatever we like.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong class="code-inline">PhysicsSystem</strong> will be responsible for moving the
            bodies every frame. Let's create a <strong class="code-inline">physicsSystem.js</strong>
            file, put it in the <strong class="code-inline">physics</strong> directory, and add the following
            code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import System from '../ecs/system';
import BodyComponent from './bodyComponent';

export default class PhysicsSystem extends System {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }

    update(delta) {
        for(const component of this.components) {
            component.velocity = component.velocity.add(component.acceleration.scale(delta));
            component.position = component.position.add(component.velocity.scale(delta));
        }
    }

    createBodyComponent(posX, posY) {
        const component = new BodyComponent(posX, posY);
        this.components.push(component);
        return component;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            As you can see, the <strong class="code-inline">PhysicsSystem</strong> is responsible for
            creating instances of <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> classes with
            the <strong class="code-inline">createBodyComponent</strong> method. The system 
            needs to store components locally so they can be iterated in the <strong class="code-inline">update()</strong>
            method. We'll use this pattern in all of our systems and let the system handle the lifecycle
            of the components its responsible for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, we'll need a system and corresponding component for the feature that draws shapes
            on the screen. Let's create a <strong class="code-inline">graphics</strong> directory, a 
            <strong class="code-inline">bodyGraphicsComponent.js</strong> file, and let's put the following
            code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import Component from "../ecs/component";

export default class BodyGraphicsComponent extends Component {
    constructor(bodyComponent) {
        super();
        this.bodyComponent = bodyComponent;
        this.setRandomColor();
    }

    setRandomColor() {
        this.color = randomColor();
    }
}

function randomColor() {
    let red = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
    let green = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
    let blue = Math.floor(Math.random()*256);
    return (red &lt;&lt; 16) + (green &lt;&lt; 8) + blue;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Like the <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> we created earlier, the
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyGraphicsComponent</strong> contains the data it needs to
            draw the ball on the screen. However, in addition to the color we also need a reference to
            the <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> instance that we're trying to draw.
            This is because the dimensions and position of the body are stored directly in the 
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> instance, and as the body moves we'll need
            an updated position to know where to draw the ball on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many ways that entities and components can communicate with each other, and in a future
            article we'll examine a popular approach (the Event Bus) in more detail, but when we have
            the opportunity to code the dependency between components directly, we should do it,
            since the easiest and simplest way that components can communicate is for one to
            hold a reference to the other and directly access its values.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong class="code-inline">GraphicsSystem</strong> goes together with the
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyGraphicsComponent</strong>, therefore we need
            to create the <strong class="code-inline">graphicsSystem.js</strong> file and put it
            in the <strong class="code-inline">physics</strong> directory. Let's also place the following
            code in that file:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import * as PIXI from "pixi.js";
import System from "../ecs/system";
import BodyGraphicsComponent from "./bodyGraphicsComponent";
import config from '../config';

export default class GraphicsSystem extends System {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.parentElement = document.getElementById(config.rootElementId);
        this.width = config.width;
        this.height = config.height;
        this.app = new PIXI.Application({width: this.width, height: this.height});
        this.parentElement.appendChild(this.app.view);
        this.graphics = new PIXI.Graphics();
        this.app.stage.addChild(this.graphics);
    }

    update() {
        this.graphics.clear();
        for(const component of this.components) {
            this.graphics.beginFill(component.color);
            this.graphics.drawCircle(component.bodyComponent.position.x, component.bodyComponent.position.y, component.bodyComponent.radius);
        }
    }

    createGraphicsComponent(bodyComponent) {
        let graphicsComponent = new BodyGraphicsComponent(bodyComponent);
        this.components.push(graphicsComponent);
        return graphicsComponent;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The <strong class="code-inline">GraphicsSystem</strong> is responsible for creating
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyGraphicsComponent</strong> instances but also for
            setting up the <strong class="code-inline">PIXI</strong> instance and directly drawing
            the graphics on the screen. The system itself holds many variables that it needs to do
            its job, such as the width of the game, the root HTML element that carries the game, and
            a few more. It's very common for system to hold their own state that is independent from
            the components.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note how we're importing data from a file called <strong class="code-inline">config.js</strong>
            that we have not defined yet. This file is useful for storing global settings. Let's create this file
            and put the following code there:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">const config = {
    width: 640,
    height: 360,
    rootElementId: 'pixi-root'
}

export default config;</code></pre>
        <p>
            The final feature we'll implement is the screen edge bounce. Like with the other features, we'll
            need a system and a component to make it work. Let's start with the component first: create
            a <strong class="code-inline">screenEdgeBounce</strong> directory, create a
            <strong class="code-inline">screenEdgeBounceComponent.js</strong> file in it, and put the following
            code in it:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import Component from '../ecs/component';

export default class ScreenEdgeBounceComponent extends Component {
    constructor(bodyComponent, graphicsComponent) {
        super();
        this.bodyComponent = bodyComponent;
        this.graphicsComponent = graphicsComponent;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The <strong class="code-inline">ScreenEdgeBounceComponent</strong> does not have any data of its
            own, but just hold references to the other two components we defined earlier. These components are
            necessary because we need to know the
            position of the ball to know when it reaches the edges of the screen, and we also need the
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyGraphicsComponent</strong> instance so we can change the color of the ball
            when it touches the edges.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might be wondering if we actually need the
            <strong class="code-inline">ScreenEdgeBounceComponent</strong> and if we could allow multiple systems
            to access the same component directly. This is generally not advisable since we might want to apply
            the system rules to only a small number of child components, for example we might not want all
            <strong class="code-inline">BodyComponent</strong> instances to bounce around the walls, but only those
            that we wrap with a <strong class="code-inline">ScreenEdgeBounceComponent</strong>. A component should
            be used to add a single behavior to an entity, and since we're dealing with multiple behaviors, it's
            best to use one component for each behavior, even if the components use the same underlying data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we can create the <strong class="code-inline">ScreenEdgeBounceSystem</strong>. Let's create
            the <strong class="code-inline">screenEdgeBounceSystem.js</strong> file in the
            <strong class="code-inline">screenEdgeBounce</strong> directory and put the following code there:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import System from '../ecs/system';
import ScreenEdgeBounceComponent from './screenEdgeBounceComponent';
import Vec2 from '../vec2';
import config from '../config';

export default class ScreenEdgeBounceSystem extends System {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.width = config.width;
        this.height = config.height;
    }

    update() {
        
        for(const component of this.components) {
            const bodyComponent = component.bodyComponent;
            const graphicsComponent = component.graphicsComponent;
            if(bodyComponent.position.x + bodyComponent.radius &gt;= this.width) {
                let diff = bodyComponent.position.x + bodyComponent.radius - this.width;
                bodyComponent.position = new Vec2(bodyComponent.position.x - 2 * diff, bodyComponent.position.y);
                bodyComponent.velocity = new Vec2(-bodyComponent.velocity.x, bodyComponent.velocity.y);
                graphicsComponent.setRandomColor();
            }
            if(bodyComponent.position.x - bodyComponent.radius &lt;= 0) {
                let diff = bodyComponent.position.x - bodyComponent.radius;
                bodyComponent.position = new Vec2(bodyComponent.position.x - 2 * diff, bodyComponent.position.y);
                bodyComponent.velocity = new Vec2(-bodyComponent.velocity.x, bodyComponent.velocity.y);
                graphicsComponent.setRandomColor();
            }
            if(bodyComponent.position.y + bodyComponent.radius &gt; this.height) {
                let diff = bodyComponent.position.y + bodyComponent.radius - this.height;
                bodyComponent.position = new Vec2(bodyComponent.position.x, bodyComponent.position.y - 2 * diff);
                bodyComponent.velocity = new Vec2(bodyComponent.velocity.x, -bodyComponent.velocity.y);
                graphicsComponent.setRandomColor();
            }
        }
    }

    createScreenEdgeBounceComponent(bodyComponent, graphicsComponent) {
        const component = new ScreenEdgeBounceComponent(bodyComponent, graphicsComponent);
        this.components.push(component);
        return component;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The functionality of this system is the same as last time, if the ball touches the left, right, or
            bottom edge of the screen, reverse its direction of movement, move it away from the edge, and change
            the color of the ball. Note how we're using the <strong class="code-inline">config</strong> object
            we declared earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we're done with the components and systems, it's time to try them out. In the
            <strong class="code-inline">index.js</strong> file, let's put the following code:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">import * as MainLoop from 'mainloop.js';

let physicsSystem = new PhysicsSystem();
let screenEdgeBounceSystem = new ScreenEdgeBounceSystem();

    entity.attachComponents(bodyComponent, graphicsComponent, screenEdgeBounceComponent);
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Like we mentioned earlier, entities are just a collection of components. When we create a ball and
            place it in the world, we create an instance of the <strong class="code-inline">Entity</strong> class
            and any other components it might need and then we create and attach any necessary components.
            Once the components have been attached, the systems take care of applying the game rules. On every
            frame we call the <strong class="code-inline">update()</strong> method of every system, and this is how
            the world gets updated over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of each frame, we call each system's <strong class="code-inline">deleteStaleComponents()</strong>
            method, which will remove from the game any component that we've deleted. In this example there are no
            such examples, but we'll leave this for the future when we have more complex behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that the order in which we update the systems matters for our game's rules.
            In our case we updated the physics first, then we checked if the ball touched the edges. This allows
            us to immediately react if the ball is touching the edges. As we add more systems for a more complex
            game, it will be important to make a design decision in which order will the rules of the game will be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            One other detail to note is how the <strong class="code-inline">GraphicsSystem</strong> is updated
            separately from the other systems. This is a feature provided by the <strong class="code-inline">MainLoop.js</strong>
            library which is normally locked at a fixed frame rate (by default 60 frames per second). By
            updating the <strong class="code-inline">GraphicsSystem</strong> during <strong class="code-inline">setDraw()</strong>
            instead of <strong class="code-inline">setUpdate()</strong>, we can get potentially smoother graphics by refreshing
            the screen as fast as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
            We finally finished the implementation of the ECS pattern. We'll be using this pattern extensively
            in the future, in general any new feature that we'll add will be implemented by adding new systems
            and their corresponding components.
